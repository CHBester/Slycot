    To find a controllable realization for the linear time-invariant
    multi-input system

          dX/dt = A * X + B * U,

    where A and B are N-by-N and N-by-M matrices, respectively,
    which are reduced by this routine to orthogonal canonical form
    using (and optionally accumulating) orthogonal similarity
    transformations.  Specifically, the pair (A, B) is reduced to
    the pair (Ac, Bc),  Ac = Z' * A * Z,  Bc = Z' * B,  given by

          [ Acont     *    ]         [ Bcont ]

     and

             [  0   0   . . .  Ap,p-1 App ]         [ 0  ]

    where the blocks  B1, A21, ..., Ap,p-1  have full row ranks and
    p is the controllability index of the pair.  The size of the
    block  Auncont is equal to the dimension of the uncontrollable
    subspace of the pair (A, B).
	
    Required arguments:

    Optional arguments:

            The tolerance to be used in rank determination when transforming 
            (A, B). If tol <= 0 a default value is used.
        ldwork := max(n,3*m) input int
            The length of the cache array. ldwork >= max(n, 3*m).
            For optimum performance it should be larger.

            the matrix of accumulated orthogonal similarity transformations 
            which reduces the given system to orthogonal canonical form.
            If jobz = 'F', the elements below the diagonal, with the array tau, 
            represent the orthogonal transformation matrix as a product of 
            elementary reflectors. The transformation matrix can then be 
            obtained by calling the LAPACK Library routine DORGQR.
            If jobz = 'N', the array Z is None.
        tau : rank-1 array('d') with bounds (n)
