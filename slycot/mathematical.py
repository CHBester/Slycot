    """
    Matrix exponential for a real non-defective matrix

     To compute exp(A*delta) where A is a real N-by-N non-defective
     matrix with real or complex eigenvalues and delta is a scalar
     value. The routine also returns the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
     of A as well as (if all eigenvalues are real) the matrix product
     exp(Lambda*delta) times the inverse of the eigenvector matrix
     of A, where Lambda is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.
     Optionally, the routine computes a balancing transformation to
     improve the conditioning of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

     ARGUMENTS

     Mode Parameters

     BALANC  CHARACTER*1
             Indicates how the input matrix should be diagonally scaled
             to improve the conditioning of its eigenvalues as follows:
             = 'N':  Do not diagonally scale;
             = 'S':  Diagonally scale the matrix, i.e. replace A by
                     D*A*D**(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix chosen
                     to make the rows and columns of A more equal in
                     norm. Do not permute.

     Input/Output Parameters

     N       (input) INTEGER
             The order of the matrix A.  N >= 0.

     DELTA   (input) DOUBLE PRECISION
             The scalar value delta of the problem.

     A       (input/output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDA,N)
             On entry, the leading N-by-N part of this array must
             contain the matrix A of the problem.
             On exit, the leading N-by-N part of this array contains
             the solution matrix exp(A*delta).

     LDA     INTEGER
             The leading dimension of array A.  LDA >= max(1,N).

     V       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDV,N)
             The leading N-by-N part of this array contains the
             eigenvector matrix for A.
             If the k-th eigenvalue is real the k-th column of the
             eigenvector matrix holds the eigenvector corresponding
             to the k-th eigenvalue.
             Otherwise, the k-th and (k+1)-th eigenvalues form a
             complex conjugate pair and the k-th and (k+1)-th columns
             of the eigenvector matrix hold the real and imaginary
             parts of the eigenvectors corresponding to these
             eigenvalues as follows.
             If p and q denote the k-th and (k+1)-th columns of the
             eigenvector matrix, respectively, then the eigenvector
             corresponding to the complex eigenvalue with positive
             (negative) imaginary value is given by
                                       2
             p + q*j (p - q*j), where j  = -1.

     LDV     INTEGER
             The leading dimension of array V.  LDV >= max(1,N).

     Y       (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDY,N)
             The leading N-by-N part of this array contains an
             intermediate result for computing the matrix exponential.
             Specifically, exp(A*delta) is obtained as the product V*Y,
             where V is the matrix stored in the leading N-by-N part of
             the array V. If all eigenvalues of A are real, then the
             leading N-by-N part of this array contains the matrix
             product exp(Lambda*delta) times the inverse of the (right)
             eigenvector matrix of A, where Lambda is the diagonal
             matrix of eigenvalues.

     LDY     INTEGER
             The leading dimension of array Y.  LDY >= max(1,N).

     VALR    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
     VALI    (output) DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (N)
             These arrays contain the real and imaginary parts,
             respectively, of the eigenvalues of the matrix A. The
             eigenvalues are unordered except that complex conjugate
             pairs of values appear consecutively with the eigenvalue
             having positive imaginary part first.

     IWORK   INTEGER array, dimension (N)

     DWORK   DOUBLE PRECISION array, dimension (LDWORK)
             On exit, if INFO = 0, DWORK(1) returns the optimal value
             of LDWORK, and if N > 0, DWORK(2) returns the reciprocal
             condition number of the triangular matrix used to obtain
             the inverse of the eigenvector matrix.

     LDWORK  INTEGER
             The length of the array DWORK.  LDWORK >= max(1,4*N).
             For good performance, LDWORK must generally be larger.
